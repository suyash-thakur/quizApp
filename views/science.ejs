                STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and encompasses a vast array of subjects that fall into each of those terms. Some common STEM areas include: aerospace engineering, astrophysics, astronomy, biochemistry, biomechanics, chemical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, computer science, mathematical biology, nanotechnology, neurobiology, nuclear physics, physics, and robotics, among many others. Occupations in STEM-related careers are some of the most rewarding and fastest growing of the 21st century. Building a solid STEM foundation through a well-rounded curriculum is the best way to ensure that students are exposed to math, science, and technology throughout their educational career.

<h1>Grades K-5/ Elementary Science</h1>
<p>
    In grades K-5, tutors inculcate observational curiosity in young minds. Tutors focus on most basic aspects of biology, ecology, geology and astronomy through observation of the world around them and general readings. </p>
<br>
<h1>Middle School Science</h1>
<p>
    In middle school, Tutors focus on biology, geology and astronomy in greater depth to help student develop curiosity and interest to investigate the world around them. This deeper curiosity and interest may ultimately result some of these student to engage in a career in science and technology.  </p>

                Economics is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on the behavior and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labor, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements. A good understanding of Economics, will open the doors to careers in many fields and professions, ranging from academic and central bank economists to investment banking. Economics is thus a highly influential subject but is also a great challenge to master. Let our trained Economics tutors help your child navigate this fascinating subject!

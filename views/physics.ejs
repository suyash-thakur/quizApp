                Physics is the branch of science that deals with the structure of matter and how the fundamental constituents of the universe interact. It studies objects ranging from the very small using quantum mechanics to the entire universe using general relativity. The laws of Physics not only explain the inner workings of our entire universe, but also of other branches of Science – such as Chemistry, Biology, and Astronomy. Knowledge of Physics is also at the forefront of advanced progress in virtually all engineering disciplines such as aeronautical and aerospace engineering, next generation quantum computer engineering, medical imaging and treatment technologies, weather and ocean engineering, renewable energy engineering and many more. A good understanding of Physics will open the doors to careers in these scientific and engineering fields to be part of the development of next generation breakthroughs to have a lasting impact on human race.  Many top engineering and scientific Colleges and Universities expect their applicants to have studied Physics at the High school level. Physics is thus highly enriching but is also a great challenge to master. Let SharpMind Labs tutors help your child to not only meet these challenges of High School Physics courses, but all succeed in them!

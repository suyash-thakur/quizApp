                Biology is the fascinating natural science that studies life and living organisms from viruses and bacteria to the most complex and developed organisms such as humans, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution. A good understanding of Biology, like Chemistry, will open the doors to careers in many fields and professions, ranging from healthcare to modern biotechnology. The career could span from being a medical professional to a life scientist with applications in Agriculture, Food Processing and Pharmaceutical industries to name a few. Many Colleges and Universities expect their applicants to have studied Biology at the High school level. Further study at the University level may be desired to be admitted to a Medical school. Biology is thus highly enriching but is also a great challenge to master. Let our trained Biology tutors help your child navigate this fascinating subject!</p>
